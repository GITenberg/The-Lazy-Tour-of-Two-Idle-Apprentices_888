description: A delightful meditation on the pleasures of bachelor bonding and an example
  of collaborative journalism at its best In autumn 1857, Charles Dickens embarked
  on a sightseeing trip to Cumberland with his friend, the rising star of literature
  Wilkie Collins. Writing together, they reported their adventures for Dickens' periodical
  Household Words, producing a showcase of both long-cherished and entirely novel
  sides of these well-loved men of letters. Boasting two ghost stories from undisputed
  masters of the genre, it also uniquely demonstrates their glee in caricaturing themselves
  and one another
